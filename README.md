# RadioactiveDecaySimulation

This project report focuses on simulating the thorium-233 nuclear decay reaction, aiming to leverage the abundant thorium reserves in India to enhance the safety and energy potential of nuclear reactors. 

By utilizing thorium instead of uranium, the project explores the feasibility of thorium-based nuclear reactions within existing uranium-based reactors. This research contributes to India's Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) program by demonstrating the conversion of thorium-232 to uranium-233 and its subsequent fission.


The simulation employs Monte Carlo methods using `GEANT4` and `ROOT` software, executed on the `Ramanujan Universe (RU) High-Performance Computing (HPC) system`. 

Our objective is to evaluate the potential for developing a fast-breeder reactor capable of generating more fuel than it consumes. Initial testing of the simulation code is conducted on personal computers before deployment on the RU system.


This collaborative research aims to provide critical insights into the thorium fuel cycle, supporting the development of sustainable and safe nuclear energy solutions in India. 

By elucidating the decay kinetics and isotopic evolution, the study seeks to pave the way for the practical implementation of thorium-based nuclear technology in existing reactor infrastructure.
